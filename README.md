The Weather App project is a project within the **Web Development** course from **ITSchool**, which as a functionality aims to show the weather forecast, the current weather and others using the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API for the city selected by the visitor.

## About
At the end of the Javascript chapter during the **Web Development** course at **ITSchool** I had to do a weather project using free API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) â›….

The application is simple, the basic features that need to be included is to display the current weather along with the five day forecast. The visitor can choose his city by a dropdown with predefined variants.

The API I used was the free plan of the [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/price), with a limit of 60 calls per minute and 1,000,000 calls per month.

You can see the demo [here](https://bc-project-weather-js.netlify.app/) ðŸ‘ˆ
